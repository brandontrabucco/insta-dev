    "The predominant approach for training web navigation agents gathers human demonstrations for a set of popular websites and hand-written tasks, but it is becoming clear that human data are an inefficient resource. We develop a pipeline to facilitate Internet-scale training for agents without laborious human annotations. In the first stage, an LLM generates tasks for 150k diverse websites. In the next stage, LLM agents complete tasks and produce trajectories. In the final stage, an LLM reviews the trajectories and judges their success. Language models are competitive with human annotators, detecting and filtering out harmful content with an accuracy of 97%, generating feasible tasks with an 89% rate, and judging successful trajectories with an 82.6% accuracy. Scaling the pipeline, agents based on Llama 3.1 70B solve 16.7% of tasks for 150k sites. Training on the data generated by our pipeline is competitive with training on human demonstrations. In data-limited settings derived from Mind2Web and WebLINX, we improve Step Accuracy by up to +89.5% and +122.1% respectively for agents trained on mixtures of data from our pipeline, and human data. When training agents with all available human data from these benchmarks, agents fail to generalize to diverse real sites, and adding our data improves their generalization by +149.0% for WebLINX and +156.3% for Mind2Web.

      "## Calculation walkthrough\n",
      " At its simplest, the model for estimating website emissions looks like this: `Estimated emissions (gCO2e/GB) = Operational emissions + Embodied emissions` For the rest of this section we will explain the models for both operational and embodied emissions. \n",
      "### Operational emissions\n",
      " To estimate operational emissions, first, we define the energy consumption intensity. To do so, we follow a top-down approach, which means that we look at the global energy consumption for each segment, as well as total data transfer. Here are the values we use for our calculations: \n",
      "* Total energy consumption for data centers: 290 TWh ( [id: 234] IEA 2022 link )\n",
      "* Total energy consumption for the network: 310 TWh ( [id: 236] IEA 2022 link )\n",
      "* Total energy consumption for user devices: 421 TWh ( [id: 238] https://pisrt.org/psr-press/journals/easl-vol-3-issue-2-2020/new... link [id: 239] Malmodin 2023 link )\n",
      "* Total data transfer across the internet: 5.29 ZB ( [id: 241] ITU 2023 link )\n",
      " By dividing the energy consumption by the total data transfer, we get the energy intensity based on data transfer for each segment: `Energy intensity (kWh/GB) = Energy consumption (kWh) / Data transfer (GB)` Then, to get the estimated energy use for each segment, we perform the following calculations (converting TWh to kWh and ZB to GB as we go): \n",
      "```\n",
      "Operational energy intensity data centers = (290 × 10 9 (kWh)) / (5.29 × 10 12 (GB)) = 0.055 kWh/GB\n",
      "\n",
      "Operational energy intensity networks = (310 × 10 9 (kWh)) / (5.29 × 10 12 (GB)) = 0.059 kWh/GB\n",
      "\n",
      "Operational energy intensity user devices = (421 × 10 9 (kWh)) /(5.29 × 10 12 (GB)) = 0.080 kWh/GB\n",
